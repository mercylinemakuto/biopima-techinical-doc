            Real-Time Monitoring
          </h2>
          <p className="text-black text-lg leading-relaxed">
            BioPima continuously tracks vital parameters including gas pressure,
            temperature, and methane leakage inside institutional biogas digesters
            via IoT sensors. This near-instantaneous data streaming enables
            operators to promptly detect and respond to abnormal system behaviors
            â€“ preventing potential safety hazards such as overpressure or digester
            microbial imbalance. Real-time monitoring assures efficient digester
            operation and optimal biogas production, supporting sustainable energy
            use and safety compliance.

            Gas Consumption Analytics
          </h2>
          <p className="text-black text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The platform provides granular analytics on biogas consumption broken
            down by specific uses such as cooking, heating, baking, and powering
            generators. This detailed usage data supports responsible resource
            management by allowing users to identify consumption patterns,
            optimize gas allocation, and forecast demand accurately. It also
            facilitates transparent cost-sharing or billing in institutional
            setups by providing verifiable consumption reports that help avoid
            disputes and encourage efficient use of biogas.

            Safety Alerts and Notifications
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-black text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
            <li>
              Instant notifications are triggered whenever gas pressure or
              temperature deviates beyond predefined safe thresholds, enabling
              operators to take corrective action quickly to prevent equipment
              damage or microbial death within digesters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Early warning alerts on methane leakage reduce environmental risks
              and energy loss by ensuring rapid identification and sealing of
              leaks, enhancing both safety and sustainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automated operational reminders for maintenance tasks such as sensor
              calibration, valve inspection, and routine system checks help
              maximize device longevity, reduce downtime, and maintain consistent
              biogas quality.
